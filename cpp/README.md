# Lab 11: Segmentation

Welcome to lab 11!

In this lab we will experiment with real time image segmentation on image streams from a camera or a prerecorded video.

Start by cloning this repository on your machine.
You can also download the [videos](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/its/TEK5030/v19/resurser/lab_11_videos.zip)
(259MB) and unzip them somewhere convenient on your computer[&ast;](#terminal).
Then open the lab project in CLion.

The lab is carried out by following these steps:

1. [Get an overview](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md)
2. [Implement simple color-based segmentation](lab-guide/2-implement-simple-color-based-segmentation.md)
4. [Further work](lab-guide/3-further-work.md)

At an appropriate time, our [proposed solution](https://github.com/tek5030/lab_11_solution) will be made available.

Please start the lab by going to the [first step](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md).
